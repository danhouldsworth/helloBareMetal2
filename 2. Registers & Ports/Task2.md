==> Read the datasheet for PORTS
==> Kit out all the boards with LEDs on the pin where available :
                        328@8MHz     328@1MHz      Nano    32u4
    BLUE    : B4 = HIGH     *           *           *       *
    RED     : B5 = HIGH     *           *           *       GRN
    WHITE   : B7 = HIGH     *           *                   *
    YELLOW  : C7 = HIGH                                     *
    GREEN   : D5 = LOW      *           *           *       *

1. Light up all LEDs on all boards. No libraries, or include statements allowed - Raw C & ASM only :-)
