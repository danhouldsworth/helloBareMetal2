10.2.3 Flash Clock ­ clkFLASH
The Flash clock controls operation of the Flash interface. The Flash clock is usually active simultaneously with the CPU clock.
10.2.4 Asynchronous Timer Clock ­ clkASY
The Asynchronous Timer clock allows the Asynchronous Timer/Counter to be clocked directly from an external clock or an external 32kHz clock crystal. The dedicated clock domain allows using this Timer/Counter as a realtime counter even when the device is in sleep mode.
10.2.5 ADC Clock ­ clkADC
The ADC is provided with a dedicated clock domain. This allows halting the CPU and I/O clocks in order to reduce noise generated by digital circuitry. This gives more accurate ADC conversion results.
10.3 Clock Sources

The device has the following clock source options, selectable by Flash Fuse bits as shown below. The clock from the selected source is input to the AVR clock generator, and routed to the appropriate modules.

Table 10-1.

Device Clocking Options Select(1) Device Clocking Option
Low Power Crystal Oscillator Full Swing Crystal Oscillator Low Frequency Crystal Oscillator Internal 128kHz RC Oscillator Calibrated Internal RC Oscillator

0011 0010 0000 0001

Note: 1. For all fuses "1" means unprogrammed while "0" means programmed.

10.3.1 Default Clock Source

The device is shipped with internal RC oscillator at 8.0MHz and with the fuse CKDIV8 programmed, resulting in 1.0MHz system clock. The startup time is set to maximum and time-out period enabled. (CKSEL = "0010", SUT = "10", CKDIV8 = "0"). The default setting ensures that all users can make their desired clock source setting using any available programming interface.
10.3.2 Clock Start-up Sequence

Any clock source needs a sufficient VCC to start oscillating and a minimum number of oscillating cycles before it can be considered stable.
To ensure sufficient VCC, the device issues an internal reset with a time-out delay (tTOUT) after the device reset is released by all other reset sources. "On-chip Debug System" on page 53 describes the start conditions for the internal reset. The delay (tTOUT) is timed from the Watchdog Oscillator and the number of cycles in the delay is set by the SUTx and CKSELx fuse bits. The selectable delays are shown in Table 10-2 on page 41. The frequency of the Watchdog Oscillator is voltage dependent as shown in "Typical Characteristics" on page 373.
